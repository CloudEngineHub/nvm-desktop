# Node Version Manager Desktop

`nvm-desktop` is a desktop application that helps you manage multiple Node.js versions through a visual interface. The application is built using [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) and supports `macOS`, `Windows`, and `Linux` systems. It allows you to easily and quickly install, manage, and switch between different Node.js versions without relying on any OS-specific features or shells.

The program also supports independently setting and switching Node.js versions between different projects. Each version's environment is isolated, meaning global dependencies installed via npm under one version will not be available when switched to another version. To share these global dependencies, you can use the `npm config set prefix "/path/to/folder"` command to install global packages in a specified directory. When switching Node.js versions, all versions will have access to the packages in that path.

The smart detection of the appropriate Node engine version is powered by [nvmd-command](https://github.com/1111mp/nvmd-command), which is a native executable written in Rust with no external dependencies.

All the files related to `nvm-desktop` are located in the `"$HOME/.nvmd/"` directory:

- `"bin/"`(floder) **All the shims of the Node.js are stored**. The path `"$HOME/.nvmd/bin` needs to be added to the environment variable of the system.

|   macOS    |           Windows           |
| :--------: | :-------------------------: |
|   `nvmd`   |         `nvmd.exe`          |
|   `node`   |         `node.exe`          |
|   `npm`    |      `npm.exe npm.cmd`      |
|   `npx`    |      `npx.exe npx.cmd`      |
| `corepack` | `corepack.exe corepack.cmd` |

- `"versions/"`(floder) **It stores all downloaded Node.js version files, and the floder is usually named with the Node.js version number**. For example: `"$HOME/.nvmd/versions/21.2.0/"`.
- `"default"`(file) **The file contains the version number of the node that is set globally**, for example: `21.2.0`.
- `"migration"`(file) Every time `nvm-desktop` is upgraded, it will control the execution of script code based on this file.

For more details, please check document: [command-tools-intro](https://github.com/1111mp/nvmd-command#command-tools-intro) .

## Install

### Download

You can download the source code and build it yourself, or download the built version from following links:

- [nvmd-desktop Download Page (GitHub release)](https://github.com/1111mp/nvm-desktop/releases)

The automatic check for updates feature of the application has supported all platforms since version `v4.0.0`.

## Uninstall

### macOS Uninstall

- Uninstall `nvm-desktop` application
- `rm -rf ~/.nvmd`
- Remove the two lines about `nvmd` from the `shell` configuration file:

  ```shell
  export NVMD_DIR="$HOME/.nvmd"
  export PATH="$NVMD_DIR/bin:$PATH"
  ```

  The default file might be:

  - .zshrc
  - .bashrc
  - .bash_profile
  - .profile

### Windows Uninstall

- Uninstall `nvm-desktop` application
- Remove `%HOMEPATH%\.nvmd` folder
- Remove environment variables from your system: `%HOMEPATH%\.nvmd\bin` (will be automatically removed when uninstalling from `v4.0.0`)

## Develop and Build

- First, you should have a Rust runtime installed locally. Please read the official guide: [Rust Get Started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Then, make sure your computer has [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed

### Development

Clone the project code to your local machine, navigate to the project’s root directory, and then run the following commands in the terminal:
- `pnpm check`: Download the `nvmd` file to the `./src-tauri/resources/` directory.
- `pnpm install`: Install the project dependencies.

There are two ways to start the development server:

- run `pnpm dev`
- `F5` one-button start (VSCode Debug Mode)

### Build and Package

- Go to the `./` folder
- Run `pnpm build`

If everything goes well, the packaged files will be in the `./src-tauri/target/release/bundle` folder.

## Managing your project

Now, you can select a different Node.js version for each project individually, without any additional dependencies or complex configurations. This feature is powered by nvmd-command, helping you maintain consistency and simplicity in your Node.js environment across multiple projects.

With this feature, you can:
- Choose a separate Node.js version for each project.
- Automatically detect the `.nvmdrc` file in the project’s root directory to determine the appropriate Node version.
- No need for manual configuration or additional tools, as `nvmd` will automatically recognize and switch to the required version.
